Welcome to BBCA: Better Basic Chat Application

Features:

Usernames
When you first log onto BBCA, the Server will prompt you to enter a username
When you have finished, press enter
If your username is invalid, the server will prompt you to resubmit a username

Public Chat:
To send a message to everyone in the chat room, you can either type “CHAT” before your message, or you can type “*” before your message. 

Personal Chatting
You can chat with a member online privately and have a conversation between you and that member
To do this, either type “PCHAT” before the username, or type “@ [the username]  [msg]”
You can also private-message any number of users at the same time by typing "@[username1] @[username2] etc. [msg]"
People on the receiving end will not see the other people that the message was sent to

Serialized Objects
The User can now send and receive serialized Objects

Chatroom Participants
Whenever a user joins/leaves the chatroom, the Server will send out a list of the members that are present in the chatroom. This can also be accessed by typing "/whoishere"

Additional features
If you want to get the attention of a certain user, you can ring them
To do this, type “/ring [username],” and the other person will receive an audible ring on their device

Exitting
To exit the chat, you can either type “QUIT”, or “/quit”

GUI
When using the Graphic interface, it will prompt you for the Server IP and Port number
When it prompts you for a name, it will ask you to re-enter it until it is only alphanumeric, with no whitespace.
In the Graphic Interface, you will notice four sections: The Chat History, Members List, Message Box, and Ring Box
To send a message, type your message into the Message Input, and press either "Send" or the Enter key on your keyboard
You can private message the same way as before, by typing "@[username] [msg]", and, similarly to the text-based client, it can handle any number of users to PCHAT to
The Members List automatically updates when a user joins/leaves the room
To ring another user, type their username into the Ring Input box and press "Ring" or the enter key on your keyboard. 
To exit the chatroom, simply close the window. "/quit" and "QUIT" will not work in the Graphic Interface.
